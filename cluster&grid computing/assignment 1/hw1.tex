% Question 1
1. \\
The power of each computer is 120 * 3 = 360 Watts.\\
So the total power of these computers is 360 * 20 = 7200 W = 7.2 kW.

2. \\
The power needed by the air conditioning system is 7.2 * $\frac{1}{3}$ = 2.4 kW.

3.\\
The total power for one hour is 7.2 + 2.4 = 9.6 KW¡¤h.
One ton equals to 12000 BTU/hr.
One BTU is also equal to 0.29 W¡¤h.
So the total tons we need is 9.6 * 1000 / (0.29 * 12000) = 2.76.

4.\\
The total power cost for a day is 2.4 * 24 * 9 = 518.4 cents = \$ 5.18 .\\
So the total power cost for a year is 5.18 * 365 = \$ 1890.7 .

5.\\
According to Ebay.com, the average price for a 3-ton chiller is around \$3500.

6.\\
According to www.homeadvisor.com, the average price of installing a air conditioning equipment in Nebraska is \$4300.\\

7.\\
According to Time Warner Cable, the price of 100 Mbps internet connection is \$100/month.\\
On Amazon.com, the price of a 20-port switches is around \$250 and each cable is \$5.\\
So the total price is 100 * 12 + 250 + 5 * 21 = 1555.

8.\\
In sum, for the first year, the total price is 1890 + 3500 + 4300 + 1555 = 11245.

9.\\
$S(10) = \frac{10}{1+(10-1) * 0.1} = \frac{10}{1.9} = 5.26$\\
So the performance of this CPU is 4 * 5.26 = 21.04 Gigaflops.

10.\\
$S_s(10)=10+(1-10)*0.1=9.1$\\
So the performance of this CPU is 4 * 9.1 = 36.4 Gigaflops.
