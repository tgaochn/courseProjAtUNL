Stage 4.\\
Running on the same dataset, code in stage 2 is much faster than code in stage 3.\\
The reason is that the A-Priori algorithm used in stage 2 has already filtered low-frequent 
items and item pairs, which leads to less calculation.\\

% 5
Stage 5.\\
After modifying files, part of the result is shown as follows. \\
Compared to stage 2, the time cost in stage 5 is 10 times more since the dataset is much larger.\\
Please find the modified file in stage5 folder.\\
